/**
 * Geometry 3044 - InputHandler Module
 *
 * NOTE: This class was removed during code audit.
 * The game handles input directly in main.js and MobileControls.js
 * using event listeners attached to window/document.
 *
 * The InputHandler class was designed but never integrated into the game.
 * Input handling is currently done via:
 * - globals.js: keys object for keyboard state
 * - main.js: setupKeyboardControls() for keyboard events
 * - MobileControls.js: Touch input handling
 *
 * If a centralized input system is needed in the future,
 * this file can be restored from git history.
