/**
 * Geometry 3044 - Drawing Utilities
 * Reusable canvas drawing functions
 *
 * NOTE: This file was cleaned up during code audit.
 * Previously contained unused utility functions that duplicated
 * functionality already implemented in ParticleSystem and other modules.
 *
 * If drawing utilities are needed in the future, consider:
 * - Using ParticleSystem's existing methods
 * - Adding new utilities here with actual usage
 */

// Currently empty - all previous functions were unused
// The following were removed as they had no callers:
// - drawGlowingCircle, drawTrail, drawStar, drawDiamond
// - drawGlowingText, drawShockwave, getPulseValue
// - hexToRgba, lightenColor, applyGlow, clearGlow
