/**
 * Geometry 3044 - RadicalSlang UI Module
 *
 * NOTE: This class was removed during code audit.
 *
 * REMOVED:
 * - RadicalSlangUI class: Never imported or instantiated anywhere.
 *   The game uses effects/RadicalSlang.js instead which is imported
 *   directly in main.js.
 *
 * This was a duplicate implementation with slightly different features
 * (kill streak tracking, position control) that was never integrated.
 *
 * The RadicalSlang system in effects/RadicalSlang.js provides:
 * - Combo threshold phrases (3x to 1000x)
 * - Kill phrases, power-up phrases, boss phrases
 * - Wave clear phrases, danger phrases
 *
 * If UI-specific slang features are needed, consider extending
 * the effects/RadicalSlang.js class or restore this from git history.
